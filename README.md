# Beneficial owners

Adds a beneficial owners array to the organization object to indicate the beneficial owners of an organization.

If beneficial ownership (BO) information is collected via contracting processes, then this extension is appropriate: for example, if tenderers are obligated to disclose their beneficial owners within their bid submission. Similarly, to use this extension, the **laws in your jurisdiction must permit the publication of personal identifiers**. 

You can find the complete guidance on publishing personal identifiers in the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard documentation](http://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/schema/guidance/identifiers.html#shared-identifiers)

On the other hand, if BO information is collected in a central register via other means, then it is recommended to publish that information as a separate dataset. The BO dataset and the OCDS dataset should [identify organizations](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/identifiers/#organization-ids) in the same way, so that users can cross-reference the datasets. The BO dataset can follow the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/en/latest/).

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Without nationality

The beneficial owner's nationality is not disclosed because the organization is listed on a regulated market (e.g. a stock exchange) that ensures adequate transparency in line with anti-money laundering legislation.
